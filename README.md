# Lawsons_Unit_1_Refactoring_Homework

I did not look at the main folder to check if what I was doing was correct until the end of the assignment so I did some things differently than they were done in the main folder, 
but I believe the changes I made had the same net positive on the conciseness of the code. The primary changes made were consolidating many redundant and unnecessary classes into fewer, and changing some into semantic tags; adding a fitting title; adding alt attributes to the images in the html file; and organizing th stylesheet from most vague tags to most specific.
